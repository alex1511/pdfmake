Poject Name: PDFMake

This is a javascript library to enable client/server side based pdf printing directly from the browser.

The software has functionalities like printing paragraphs, tables, canvas and allows to define own styles and fonts.

It is a very easy to use tool because it allows its users to use fully declarative commands about the document structure, while software does the x & y calculations in the background.

We see the usecase of pdfmake for other 3rd party softwares to easily export documents in .pdf files rather than use it for personal usage. One example of 3rd party programs using pdfmake is the novel writing tool called Novlr.org.
