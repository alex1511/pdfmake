### Poject Name: PDFMake ###

#Brief Scription#

This is a javascript library to enable client/server side based pdf printing directly from the browser.

The software has functionalities like printing paragraphs, tables, canvas and allows to define own styles and fonts.

It is a very easy to use tool because it allows its users to use fully declarative commands about the document structure, while software does the x & y calculations in the background.

We see the usecase of pdfmake for other 3rd party softwares to easily export documents in .pdf files rather than use it for personal usage. One example of 3rd party programs using pdfmake is the novel writing tool called Novlr.org.

#Process Development#

The project team used an Agile process development with a continuous development/continuous integration approach. They used tools like "travis-ci". They work on a sprint basis release schedule as they release one new version every 20 days / 1 month. This proves that they have to be constantly testing and integrating otherwise this would not have been possible.

Besides, knowing that they use travis-ci to validate the versions, we can infer that they use some kind of coding standards.

#Critics, Opinions and Alternatives#

We believe this is the best approach for an open source kind of project because at every moment the tool needs to be ready to receive more functionalities from other contributors without messing up with the existing ones and this is not possible with a classical development process where a new functionality implies going back to beginning and testing everything again.

One problem we see with the management of the project is that they don't keep a product backlog. This way it's not possible for contributors to see what issues and functionalities are currently worked or have to be worked on. Therefore for example it could happen, that a contributor starts working on a issue that is already being developed.

Another problem we could point is the lack of communication in the project. We see that, among the contributor, there are a few comments in a few issues and we believe that in a project like this the communication is very important part to keep the process efficient.
