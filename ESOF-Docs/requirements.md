#Functional Requirements#
Functional requirement define what a sysytem is supposed to do like calculations, technical details, data manipulation and processing and other specific functionalities.

When it comes to functional requirements, it's key that the system is able to do a number of functions related to created pdf file, such as:
* being able to open it in the browser in a new tab
* print it and download it onto the user's PC.
The system should create an html doc out of the user's input or out of a text file.
It needs to allow a certain level of customisation, using user-defined styles.

In terms of customisation, it needs to:  
* allow the printing of page numbers
* allow the printing of custom page breaks
* allow the printing of static/dynamic content
* allow the printing of numbered and bulleted lists
* allow the printing of table headers
* allow the printing of images and graphics
* allow the printing of non-breaking rows and sections
* allow the printing of text-alignements
* allow the printing of margins and column/row spans
* allow the use of embeded fonts
* allow the management of document styles
* allow adjustments to be made to the page's dimensions and orientation.

#Non-Functional Requirements#
Non-functional requirements define how the system is supposed to be, along with its qualities.

In pdfmake the system should be client-sided in its implementation. The printing function should be auto-triggering. 
The user should be able to create PDFs using a simplified, object oriented language, which will be converted into html before it is printed.
The project should be open source, and allow for many new features to be continuously implemented by various members. 
Finally, it should be easy for other developers to implement this system in their own projects.
