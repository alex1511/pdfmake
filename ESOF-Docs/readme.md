#PDFMake#

##Brief Description##

This is a software written in javascript to enable client/server side based pdf printing directly from the browser. It has functionalities like printing paragraphs, tables, canvas and allows to define own styles and fonts, which you can use by writing fully declarative commands, which lets you design the document and its structure without having to worry about the x&y calculations.

We see the usecase and value of pdfmake for other 3rd party softwares to easily export documents in .pdf files rather than to use it for personal usage. One example of 3rd party programs using pdfmake is the novel writing tool called Novlr.org. Moreover, in the readme of the project it is stated that many html5 apps use it for printing.
