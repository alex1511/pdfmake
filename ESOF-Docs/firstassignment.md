#1. Assignment: PDFmake Development Process#

##Development Process##

The project is managed in an agile development approach. They are having a continous development & integration workflow, using 'Travis-CI' to easily validate and test the contributions. Looking at the release history, we can say that they are releasing on a kind off sprint like schedule with short intervals of 20 days - 1 month. Moreover, because of 'Travis-CI' we can assume that they as well use some kind of code standards.

The 'process' however seems to be more loose than typical agile development processes like 'scrum'. We can not see any clear role division of the contributors like you would have in Scrum with an product owner, the scrum master and the team, or any clear sprint schedule and workflow.

##Critics, Opinions and Alternatives##

We believe this is the best approach for an open source project because at every moment the tool needs to be ready to receive more functionalities from other contributors without messing up with the existing ones and this is not possible with a classical development process where a new functionality implies going back to beginning and testing everything again.

Moreover, especially because many 3rd party apps are using pdfmake, the requirements to the software can often change specifically for a new application. Therefore the agile, iterative approach with short cycle releases is superior in that volatile environment over a classic software engineering approach like the 'waterfall process', which has its strength in a static project with clear outcomes.

One problem we see with the management of the project is that they don't keep a product backlog. This way it's not possible for contributors to easily see what issues and functionalities are currently worked or have to be worked on. Therefore for example it could happen, that a contributor starts working on a issue that is already being developed.

Another problem we could point is the lack of communication in the project. Communication is stated as one of the core values in the XP manifest and is needed to ensure the development processes efficency and focus. But we see that, among the contributor, there are a few comments in a few issues.

This is especially a problem in the more loose process environment pointed out in the development process section. We do not think the loose management is a problem in it self and is pretty normal and suiting for an open source project, which should be flexible and distributed in its team structure. It however requires an even more active communication than with a clearly organized process.
